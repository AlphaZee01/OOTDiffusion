- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Test interface loads and functions
- [ ] Health checks work
- [ ] Error handling is robust

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### 1. Local Testing
```bash
# Test Python setup
python quick_start.py

# Test Docker setup
docker-compose up -d

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:7865/health
curl http://localhost:7865/docs

# Test with sample images
# Open test_interface.html and test with sample images
```

### 2. API Testing
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Docs endpoint loads correctly
- [ ] Process endpoint accepts valid requests
- [ ] Process endpoint rejects invalid requests
- [ ] Error responses are properly formatted

### 3. Model Download Testing

## 📋 User Experience Testing

### 1. New User Experience
```bash
# Simulate new user
git clone https://github.com/AlphaZee01/OOTDiffusion.git
cd OOTDiffusion
python quick_start.py
```

**Expected Flow**:
1. Dependencies install automatically
2. Models download automatically
3. API starts successfully
4. User can access test interface
5. User can process images

### 2. Docker User Experience
```bash
# Simulate Docker user
git clone https://github.com/AlphaZee01/OOTDiffusion.git
cd OOTDiffusion
docker-compose up -d
```

**Expected Flow**:
